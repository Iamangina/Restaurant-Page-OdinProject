# Restaurant Page - Odin Project

## Introduction
This project is a dynamic restaurant homepage built entirely using JavaScript for DOM manipulation. By the end, all the content of the website-including the homepage, menu, and contact pages-is generated dynamically with JavaScript. Styling is done using a separate CSS file.  

The goal of this project is to practice creating and manipulating DOM elements, modular JavaScript, and implementing tabbed navigation functionality.

## Features
- **Dynamic content generation**: All elements inside `<div id="content">` are created using JavaScript.  
- **Tabbed navigation**: Switch between Home, Menu, and Contact pages without reloading the site.  
- **Modular design**: Each page/tab is implemented in its own JavaScript module for better code organization.  
- **Webpack setup**: Bundles JavaScript modules and assets into a `dist` folder for deployment.  
- **Deployment ready**: Deployed on GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch.
